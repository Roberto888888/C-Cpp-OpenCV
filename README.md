# OpenCV in C/C++
Exercises to familiarize with the OpenCV library in C (mostly).

Note that OpenCV is not a standard library and it needs to be downloaded and set up with an IDE (in the simplest way). Depending on the setup the inclusion might differ.
In my case, for some reason I couldn't connect it with Visual Studio so I connected it with CodeBlocks.

- Exercise 1 - Image Loading, Display, and Storage.
- Exercise 2 - Binary Images.
- Exercise 3 - Image Filters.
- Exercise 4 - Contours.
