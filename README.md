# OpenCV in C/C++
Exercises to familiarize with the OpenCV library in C (mostly).

Note that OpenCV is not a standard library and to use it in C/C++ it needs to be downloaded and set up with your IDE of choice.
Depending on the setup the instructions to include the library might differ.
In my case, for some reason I wasn't able to set it up with Visual Studio. I used CodeBlocks instead because it was the only IDE for which I could find a detailed and precise step to step procedure for setting it up.

- Exercise 1 - Image Loading, Display, and Storage.
- Exercise 2 - Binary Images.
- Exercise 3 - Image Filters.
- Exercise 4 - Contours.

NOTE:
In Python it's much easier to use OpenCV (you just need to use pip or conda) but I find the C++ version of OpenCV to be much better. Also, there aren't many good sources out there to study from if you choose Python whereas for C and C++ there are 2 excellent and exhaustive books by Adrian Kaehler and Gary Bradsky.

The C version of OpenCV is deprecated I think but the online documentation is still available. Some functions don't work perfectly or as easily as in C++ (for this reason I had to switch to C++ a few times though in my course I was expected to use C).
